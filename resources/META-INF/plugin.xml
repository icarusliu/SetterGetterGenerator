  <description>
    This plugin is for generating setter and getter methods for beans. Unlike other similar plugins, it will generate three methods for each field: one normal getter
    method and two setter methods. One of the setter method is the normal setter method with void as it's return, the other one uses 'this' as it's return. For example,
    if we defined a class 'Test' with a field named 'id', with this plugin, three methods would be created: public void setId(Long id){...}, public Long getId() {...},
    public Test id(Long id) {...}. After installing it, a new menu item will be created in the menu of 'Window'. You must promise that the class you want to process
    has been opened in the editor before you click this menu item.
